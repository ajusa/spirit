TODO
Migrate a project to use it
Add source control
Minify and gz to see the size
Make CSS simpler where possible (especially forms)
Set up PostCSS build pipeline

DONE
Split up into files
Buttons
Forms
Implement row vs grid, rework the existing grid
Use ma2, ma1, ma0, pa2, pa1, pa0 etc
Better names (following BeerCSS)
Use h1, h2, h3 for height and w1, w2, w3 for width. Not sure what to use for both (?)
Simplify summary
Use CSS variables
Add dark mode
Add slight roundness to buttons (and other elements?)
Create docs for each and every code sample
Remove anything that can be added with an autoprefixer
Add text helpers to headings
Add size helpers from Beer
Add large/small helpers to headings?
Make text helpers consistent (thing-text), not text-thing
Improve hint color? Maybe make it same as muted?
Maybe bring in the off canvas stuff and the calendar?
Fix centered empty state
See if menu border should be removed and figure out how to reuse it for a sidebar
Forms look good, rework inline and maybe "field" based to use .row instead
Add a class that fades content in for page transitions
Only do a demo page, drop the docs page
Fix toggle switch placement
Fix loading icon placement in input
Make the configurable knobs easier and simpler
Get a high level critique of the framework and see if it is consistent
